# RSE Phenotypes

This is a repository of Research Software Engineer Phenotypes, generated

## Why do we have phenotypes?

The act of creating the phenotype, in an of itself, can provide great insights.
Thinking about the dimension(s) under which you (or a fellow Research Software
Engineer) are defined can encourage introspection and reveal
insights about different ways that we can define RSEs. 

In addition, we've provided a listing of questions below to support this introspection.
If you have additional questions to add, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://www.github.com/usrse/rse-phenotypes).

## Questions

### Definition

 - **What is a Research Software Engineer?**: Based on your experience, how would you define a Research Software Engineer?
 - **What are the dimensions of a Research Software Engineer?**: Do you see most RSEs being defined on a set of dimensions? For example, is it typical to see an RSE lie somewhere on a dimension between domain researcher and software engineer, or are there more dimensions?
 - **What are your primary roles?** Break down your day to day life into percentages of what you do, who you interact with, etc.
 - **Why is this a relatively new role?** and why did it come to be?
 - **If I'm an interested student, how do I become a Research Software Engineer?** and if I'm an RSE, how do I get engaged with other RSEs?

### Goals and Challenges

 - **What are your primary goals?** and specifically, what goals do you have for your community, and for yourself?
 - **What are some of the challenges that you face?** On a day to day basis, what makes your life hard?
 - **How do you manage your own growth?** Or is there an external method?
 - **What do you see as the future of RSEs?** Specifically, how is the world now, and how do you want it to be?
 - **What makes you unique from other RSEs?**

### Interaction

 - **How do you interact with others?** Specifically, how do you interact with people at your institution, other institutions, and in industry?
 - **Are you active in open source?** and do you think open source is a component of being an RSE?

### Funny

 - **Tell us something funny or special about your institution**
 - **How do you catch a Research Software Engineer in the wild?**
